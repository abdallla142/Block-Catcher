## How to Play Block-Catcher

Follow these steps to get the game running on your computer:

1.  **Download the Game Files:**
    You can get the game files from this repository by either:
    * **Cloning the repository (recommended for Git users):**
        Open your terminal or command prompt and run:
        ```bash
        git clone [https://github.com/abdallla142/Block-Catcher.git](https://github.com/abdallla142/Block-Catcher.git)
        cd Block-Catcher
        ```
    * **Downloading as a ZIP:** Go to the main repository page on GitHub, click the green `Code` button, and select `Download ZIP`. Unzip the downloaded folder to a convenient location on your computer (e.g., your Desktop).

2.  **Install Python:**
    If you don't already have Python installed, download it from the official website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
    * **Important for Windows users:** During the Python installation process, make sure to check the box that says "**Add Python to PATH**." This will make it much easier to run Python commands from your terminal.

3.  **Create `requirements.txt`:**
    Your game uses the `pygame` library. To ensure it's installed, you need a `requirements.txt` file.
    * In the main `Block-Catcher` folder you downloaded (the one containing `catch blocks2.0.py`), create a **new plain text file** named `requirements.txt`.
    * Open this new file and type the following single line into it:
        ```
        pygame
        ```
    * **Save** the `requirements.txt` file.

4.  **Open Your Terminal or Command Prompt:**
    * **Windows:** Search for "Command Prompt" or "PowerShell" in your Start menu and open it.
    * **Mac/Linux:** Open your "Terminal" application.

5.  **Navigate to the Game Folder:**
    In your terminal, use the `cd` (change directory) command to go into the `Block-Catcher` folder you downloaded in Step 1.
    * **Example (adjust the path to where you saved your folder):**
        * **Windows:** `cd C:\Users\YourUsername\Desktop\Block-Catcher` (Replace `YourUsername` with your actual Windows username)
        * **Mac/Linux:** `cd ~/Desktop/Block-Catcher`
    * Press **Enter** after typing the command.

6.  **Install Game Dependencies:**
    Once you are in the `Block-Catcher` folder in your terminal, run this command to install Pygame:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    This command will read the `requirements.txt` file and install `pygame`.

7.  **Launch the Game!**
    After Pygame has finished installing, you can start the game by running the main Python file:
    ```bash
    python "catch blocks2.0.py"
    ```
    *(Note: We use quotes around `"catch blocks2.0.py"` because the filename contains spaces.)*

    The game window should now appear! Enjoy playing Block-Catcher!
