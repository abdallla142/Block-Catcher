Ready to catch some blocks? Here’s how to get the game set up and start playing:
 * Get the Game Files:
   First, you need the game files. Head over to the abdallla142/Block-Catcher repository on GitHub. You can either:
   * Download as a ZIP: Click the green "Code" button and select "Download ZIP." Once downloaded, unzip the folder to a spot you'll remember on your computer (like your Desktop).
   * Clone the repository (if you use Git): Open your terminal or command prompt and run git clone https://github.com/abdallla142/Block-Catcher.git.
 * Install Python:
   If you don't have Python installed, grab it from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/. Important for Windows users: During installation, make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH." This makes running commands much smoother.
 * Create requirements.txt:
   The game needs pygame to run. In the main Block-Catcher folder you downloaded (the one containing catch blocks2.0.py), create a new plain text file named requirements.txt. Open it and type this single line:
   pygame

   Then, save the file.
 * Open Your Terminal/Command Prompt:
   * Windows: Search for "Command Prompt" or "PowerShell" in your Start menu and open it.
   * Mac/Linux: Find and open your "Terminal" application.
 * Go to the Game Folder:
   In your terminal, use the cd (change directory) command to navigate into the Block-Catcher folder you just downloaded.
   * Example (adjust for your path): If you unzipped it to your Desktop, you might type: cd C:\Users\YourUsername\Desktop\Block-Catcher (Windows) or cd ~/Desktop/Block-Catcher (Mac/Linux). Press Enter after.
 * Install Pygame:
   Once you're in the right folder in your terminal, run this command:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   This will install pygame for you.
 * Launch the Game!
   After Pygame finishes installing, you can start the game by typing:
   python "catch blocks2.0.py"

   (We use quotes around the filename because of the space in "catch blocks2.0.py").
   The game window should pop right up!
